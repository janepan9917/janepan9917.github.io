Because I honestly think I'm a better reviewer than 90% of writers at IGN.

## Introduction
I've bought so many games I'm honestly forgetting which ones I've played and what I thought of them.

## JRPGS
### Fire Emblem
* **The Good**: 
* **The Bland**: 
* **The Ugly**: 
* **Best For**: 
* **Favorite Character**: 
* **Completed**: 

### Suikoden Tierkreis
* **The Good**: 108 recruitable and playable characters, most of whom are actually related to the story, bear compelling narratives, and are visually and personally distinct from each other. Good fight animations for its era. 
* **The Bland**: Turn-based combat. Music that just barely hits "decent" for the high standards set by JRPG composers.
* **The Ugly**: Random encounter hell.
* **Best For**: Weebs who want to pretend they have more than three friends.
* **Favorite Character**: Roberto, the angsty tsundere we all love.
* **Completed**: Almost -- got scared to fight the final boss.
