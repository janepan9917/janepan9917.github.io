Because I honestly think I'm a better reviewer than 90% of writers at IGN.

## Introduction
I've bought so many games I'm honestly forgetting which ones I've played and what I thought of them. I'm using the [Dunkey scoring system](https://i.redd.it/spm9kpw52oa01.png).

## Base-Building/Survival 
### ARK: Survival Evolved
* **The Good**: You can ride a dinosaur.
* **The Bland**: Characters are ugly, especially yours.
* **The Ugly**: Ever tried to 1v500 a pack of infinitely spawning velociraptors?
* **Best For**: Someone who REALLY wants to ride a T-Rex.
* **Favorite Character**: The pterodactyl.
* **Completed**: About 50 hours.
* **Score**: 2/5

### Don't Starve Together
* **The Good**: Fantastic visual style; I love the take on cute-meets-creepy. It genuinely gets scary and the grim tone is balanced by the cartoonish visuals. The base-building isn't overly complicated and exploring is fun.
* **The Bland**: You absolutely need to play this with friends. Can be a bit punishing at first. 
* **The Ugly**: Once you get a good system going for getting food and you've explored enough, you kind of start to wonder what the point is. A game whose degree of interestingness is predicated on the stress it inflicts on you is just... I don't know.
* **Best For**: Someone who wants a unique and interesting survival game that friends can easily pick up.
* **Favorite Character**: The robot.
* **Completed**: About 15 hours.
* **Score**: 3/5



## FPS
### Apex Legends
* **The Good**: Incredibly satisfying and fluid sense of motion. Even if you have a negative K/D, like me, it still feels fun to slide around and jump and pick up loot. A very good ping system.
* **The Bland**: If you have a negative K/D, like me, prepare to die early and often. Also, everybody is a health sponge. 
* **The Ugly**: They took the Spitty out of play >:((((
* **Best For**: Someone who wants to try FPS but doesn't know how to shoot, yet doesn't care.
* **Favorite Character**: "I am Blóðhundur, you can call me Bloodhound."
* **Completed**: I played several hundred hours. The KD never left sub-zero.
* **Score**: 3/5

### Borderlands 2
* **The Good**: Strong sense of campy-ness; it doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you. Satisfying, though easy combat. Siren is busted.
* **The Bland**: You basically need to play this with friends or it's super boring.
* **The Ugly**: Some of the jokes go past campy and into repulsive. 
* **Best For**: Someone who can't play FPS but wants to feel like they're good at shooters.
* **Favorite Character**: Maya.
* **Completed**: Yes.
* **Score**: 3/5

### CS:GO
* **The Good**: Clean and precise gunplay.
* **The Bland**: Why have the graphics not been updated since 2005?
* **The Ugly**: I thought League was bad about flaming noobs :'(
* **Best For**: Someone who uses aim trainers and has an ego about not wanting to play Valorant.
* **Favorite Character**: None.
* **Completed**: I didn't even make it to 10 hours...
* **Score**: 2/5

### Destiny 2
* **The Good**: The graphics are SUPER clean, especially for a free-to-play game. Some of the character powers are well thought out and genuinely fun to play.
* **The Bland**: This entire game. It's an infinity of "go to this point on the map" and "kill X number of Y" quests. Also, who's writing the goddamn dialogue? Also, my god did they go heavy handed with the auto-aim.
* **The Ugly**: Did they run out of funds for voice actors and pull in the janitors for the voice lines?
* **Best For**: Someone who wants the most brain dead of brain dead shooters -- so brain dead you don't even need to try to shoot.
* **Favorite Character**: None.
* **Completed**: Less than 5 hours.
* **Score**: 1/5


## JRPGS
### Fire Emblem Awakening
* **The Good**: We owe the existence of Intelligent Systems to this game, and without it, FE3H would not exist. QOL adjustments to TRPG mechanics. Pair-up system mechanic is interesting. Support convos + Barracks systems cuts the fat of the social sims.
* **The Bland**: Copy-pasted level design. Some of the supports are... dumb.
* **The Ugly**: I am not a matchmaker, nor should I need to make an Excel spreadsheet to be one. Also, parents marrying other people's children? Yeesh.
* **Best For**: Weebs who want to experience "classic" Fire Emblem without it actually being classic at all.
* **Favorite Character**: Frederick
* **Completed**: Gave up after the third marriage.
* **Score**: 2/5

### Fire Emblem Fates
* **The Good**: ...I guess it kept IS afloat long enough for the development of FE3H. Three branching paths is ambitious.
* **The Bland**: The nicer end of the anime aesthetics. Some of the character designs are passable. The TRPG elements are well-tuned enough, with less repetitive bullshit than previous works in the franchise.
* **The Ugly**: The worst of the anime aesthetics. Everybody and their mother is a dragon. Camilla is my hell. Also, paying money to unlock a golden ending is a bullshit concept.
* **Best For**: Weebs.
* **Favorite Character**: None.
* **Completed**: I watched Corrin turn into a dragon and my eyes rolled so hard it crashed the emulator.
* **Score**: 1/5

### Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn
* **The Good**: More interesting map design than previous games.
* **The Bland**: Micaela is a kind healer, wow. What a shocker.
* **The Ugly**: The fact that I honestly can't remember more to write about should be an indicator.
* **Best For**: Weebs who, like me, were suffering from FE3H withdrawal and were desperate for any facsimile of it.
* **Favorite Character**: None.
* **Completed**: I think I got about 3 maps in before I got bored.
* **Score**: 2/5

### Fire Emblem Three Houses
* **The Good**: Exceptional execution of TRPG mechanics. A narrative that stands up well enough for a diverse and likeable cast, at least one of which you will become unhealthily obsessed with. Social sim mechanics are well balanced by the battle systems. Most importantly, a sense of narrative grandeur and immersion in the world.
* **The Bland**: Monastery gets a bit old, especially in the second phase. Quality of support conversations is highly variable; oftentimes I skipped.
* **The Ugly**: Silent protagonist and some particularly frustrating level design (e.g. fog of war, infinite reinforcements).
* **Best For**: Weebs who fantasize about military strategy but are too dumb to actually study it.
* **Favorite Character**: Dimitri.
* **Completed**: Yes, three times.
* **Score**: 4/5

### Suikoden Tierkreis
* **The Good**: 108 recruitable and playable characters, most of whom are actually related to the story, bear compelling narratives, and are visually and personally distinct from each other. Good fight animations for its era. 
* **The Bland**: The epitome of generic turn-based combat. Music that just barely hits "decent" for the high standards set by JRPG composers.
* **The Ugly**: Random encounter hell.
* **Best For**: Weebs who want to pretend they have more than three friends.
* **Favorite Character**: Roberto, the angsty tsundere we all love.
* **Completed**: Almost -- got scared to fight the final boss.
* **Score**: 2/5. I'd personally give it a 3/5 because it hits that nostalgia button real good.

### Yakuza: Like A Dragon
* **The Good**: An intensely well-realized world, with so many levels of details and minigames. A genuinely likeable protagonist with an interesting though very slowly-paced narrative.
* **The Bland**: Such a sluggish turn-based combat that tries to incorporate real-time elements, to very little avail. There is, however, an interesting lore reason for why turn-based combat is the primary mechanic.
* **The Ugly**: When the minigames are funner than the actual game, you've got a problem on your hands.
* **Best For**: A patient escapist who wants to experience a satirization of Japanese culture.
* **Favorite Character**: Kasuga.
* **Completed**: I got about 25% through before I got bored by the combat and the infinitely trailing story.
* **Score**: 2/5

## Puzzle Games
### Antichamber
* **The Good**: A novel concept for a puzzle game.
* **The Bland**: It's another walking puzzle game. The graphics can get a little rough on the eyes.
* **The Ugly**: I remember that the concept was novel, but not the concept itself. That's pretty bad. Also, I definitely remember cheesing the levels by randomly walking in directions until I solved the puzzle.
* **Best For**: Someone who wants a chill puzzle game with an interesting premise.
* **Favorite Character**: None.
* **Completed**: I remember so little about this game, I don't even know if I finished it.
* **Score**: 2/5

### Botanicula
* **The Good**: Strong aesthetic style, and I love the idea of a plant-based puzzle game. Little visual details make for a stylistic and charming tone.
* **The Bland**: The puzzles. They're all poorly motivated, if that makes sense -- a lot of convoluted "puzzle game logic" going on, and it's not very inspiring.
* **The Ugly**: I got stuck on a puzzle and my ego hurts.
* **Best For**: Someone with a green thumb who isn't really into video games.
* **Favorite Character**: None.
* **Completed**: Fuck that puzzle >:(
* **Score**: 2/5


## Simulation Game
### Abzu
* **The Good**: Astoundingly beautiful graphics and a fantastic exploration of the sea. The dolphin level is still one of the most exquisite visuals I've seen in a video game.
* **The Bland**: There's a narrative. I don't remember it at all.
* **The Ugly**: It's an underwater walking sim.
* **Best For**: Someone who loves the ocean and had a bad day.
* **Favorite Character**: The dolphins for sure.
* **Completed**: Yes.
* **Score**: 4/5

## Roguelikes

## RPGs
### Bastion
* **The Good**: Great aesthetics and visuals. Tight controls. You can see the nascent virtues that would later make Supergiant Games such a powerhouse indie studio. It's a classic for a reason.
* **The Bland**: I do not remember a single plotline or even the main character's name.
* **The Ugly**: None that I remember.
* **Best For**: Someone who wants a decent and fun action game for less than $10.
* **Favorite Character**: None.
* **Completed**: About 30%.
* **Score**: 3/5

## Visual Novels
### Dangonronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc
* **The Good**: A very cleanly curated style. The devs put time into the aesthetic and tone, and it shows. It's unique for a visual novel.
* **The Bland**: Awful first person movement. I understand the intention behind the interrogation mechanics, I really do. I want to like the truth bullets. I just think it's so... so... boring....
* **The Ugly**: Some of the most grotesque death scenes. There's something weirdly fetishitic and perverse about them, more so than in other video games.
* **Best For**: Someone who wants a decent and fun action game for less than $10.
* **Favorite Character**: None.
* **Completed**: About 30%.
* **Score**: 2/5
