Thanks for visiting my website! So nice to meet you :D

About me
======

My name is Jane. I'm a first year Master's student at Princeton University in the Department of Computer Science. I study machine learning, specializing in natural language processing. Broadly, I'm interested in large language models and their performance in the few-shot regime, as well as in-context learning and prompting methods for structured prediction.

I am a member of the Princeton NLP Group; I'm fortunate to be advised by [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). Previously, I worked with [Chunhua Weng](https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/) on NLP for the biomedical domain.

I graduated _magna cum laude_ from Columbia University with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, where I was a Davis Scholar performing research with the Data Science Institute. Before I dived into ML research, I worked in quantitative finance and data science at Morgan Stanley and Acadian Asset Management. I've also completed research projects in reinforcement learning applied to machine learning, computational genomics, and biophysics.

I love teaching mathematics, especially proof-based courses or courses related to machine learning. At Princeton, I teach introductory theoretical computer science (COS 340/240); at Columbia, I taught Artificial Intelligence (COMS 4701) and Discrete Mathematics (COMS 3203).

In my free time, I enjoy reading and writing; my favorite author is John Steinbeck, and I'm very interested in modernist poetry. Lately, I've been interested with [origami](https://jonakashima.com.br/2021/05/11/origami-monkey/) and fitness.
