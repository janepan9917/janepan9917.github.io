Welcome to my website! So nice to meet you :D

About me
======

My name is Jane. I'm a first year Master's student at Princeton University in the Department of Computer Science. I study machine learning, specializing in natural language processing.

I am a member of the Princeton NLP Group; I'm fortunate to be advised by [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). Previously, I worked with [Chunhua Weng](https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/) on NLP for the biomedical domain.

I graduated _magna cum laude_ from Columbia University with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics.
