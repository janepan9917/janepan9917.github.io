_Erlebnis_ and _VorfrÃ¼hling_.

### Erlebnis[^title]
Translation by [Mary Kinzie](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=48276).

> Half-light filled the valley with a mist <br>
> Of aromatic silver as when moonlight <br>
> Seeps through the clouds. And yet it was not night. <br>
> Grey glimmering, the fragrance of the glen <br>
> Dissolved into itself what I half thought <br>
> And quietly I sank into transparent <br>
> Rocking oceans and gave up my life. <br>
> What extraordinary flowers were there, <br>
> With throats that darkly glowed, also thickets <br>
> Into which a ruddy topaz fire <br>
> Like lava coursed and smoldered. Everything <br>
> Was filled with deep harmonic swells  <br>
> Of melancholy music. And I knew <br>
> (Although I don't yet understand it) -- knew <br>
> That this was death, transformed as music, <br>
> Craving; rough; and sweet and bright and dark, <br>
> Akin to deepest sadness. <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; But how strange! <br>
> A nameless yearning wept for life <br>
> Without a sound within my soul, weeping <br>
> As one might when, on an ocean vessel <br>
> With massive yellow sails against the waves <br>
> Of Persian blue toward evening, he is borne <br>
> Along the city that was home. He sees there <br>
> Lanes, hears lapping springs, smells <br>
> Perfume from the lilacs, sees himsself, <br>
> A child upon the bank with a child's eyes, <br>
> Anxious and about to cry; and then sees <br>
> Through the open window a light on in his room -- <br>
> But the great ship conveys him out to sea <br>
> On dark blue water, gliding soundlessly <br>
> With massive yellow otherworldly sails.
