_Erlebnis_.

## Introduction
Better known as a librettist, Hofmannsthal was an Austrian prodigy who wrote for several of Strauss's operas. With a thematic emphasis on death, the ephemeral, and melancholy, his poetry featured finely rendered depictions of nature, particularly water and air. I see a strong connection between Hofmannsthal and the modernist poets that followed. 

He later stopped writing; in his [letter to Lord Chandos](https://depts.washington.edu/vienna/documents/Hofmannsthal/Hofmannsthal_Chandos.htm), he explains:

> My case, in short, is this: I have lost completely the abil­ity to think or to speak of anything coherently... For me everything disintegrated into parts, those parts again into parts; no longer would anything let itself be en­compassed by one idea. Single words floated round me; they congealed into eyes which stared at me and into which I was forced to stare back-whirlpools which gave me vertigo and, reeling incessantly, led into the void... the whole thing is a kind of feverish thinking, but thinking in a medium more immediate, more liquid, more glowing than words. It, too, forms whirlpools, but of a sort that do not seem to lead, as the whirlpools of language, into the abyss, but into myself and into the deepest womb of peace.

### _Erlebnis_

The title _Erlebnis_ is often translated as "An Experience", or sometimes "A Vision". 

> Half-light filled the valley with a mist <br>
> Of aromatic silver as when moonlight <br>
> Seeps through the clouds. And yet it was not night. <br>
> Grey glimmering, the fragrance of the glen <br>
> Dissolved into itself what I half thought <br>
> And quietly I sank into transparent <br>
> Rocking oceans and gave up my life. <br>
> What extraordinary flowers were there, <br>
> With throats that darkly glowed, also thickets <br>
> Into which a ruddy topaz fire <br>
> Like lava coursed and smoldered. Everything <br>
> Was filled with deep harmonic swells  <br>
> Of melancholy music. And I knew <br>
> (Although I don't yet understand it) -- knew <br>
> That this was death, transformed as music, <br>
> Craving; rough; and sweet and bright and dark, <br>
> Akin to deepest sadness. <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; But how strange! <br>
> A nameless yearning wept for life <br>
> Without a sound within my soul, weeping <br>
> As one might when, on an ocean vessel <br>
> With massive yellow sails against the waves <br>
> Of Persian blue toward evening, he is borne <br>
> Along the city that was home. He sees there <br>
> Lanes, hears lapping springs, smells <br>
> Perfume from the lilacs, sees himself, <br>
> A child upon the bank with a child's eyes, <br>
> Anxious and about to cry; and then sees <br>
> Through the open window a light on in his room -- <br>
> But the great ship conveys him out to sea <br>
> On dark blue water, gliding soundlessly <br>
> With massive yellow otherworldly sails.
