I can't believe I used to think _The Wasteland_ was hard to read.

## _Canto IV_
I've had this poem bookmarked for about two years now, yet never got past the first stanza. Imagism is already hard enough to interpret, and Pound's work is quadruply so, with his allusions to obscure figures of classical mythology and superposition of sensory [ideograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideogrammic_method). For those of us who last read _Percy Jackson_ in fifth grade, I've tried to annotate _Canto VI_ as legibly as possible.

> Disclaimer: I'm confident only in my ability to browse Wikipedia and steal annotations from these [excellent](http://ezrapoundcantos.org/index.php/a-draft-of-xvi-cantos-overview/canto-iv/companion-to-canto-iv) [resources](https://www.towernotes.co.uk/literature-notes-52_Pound_Cantos_10.php). No guarantees on the validity of any deeper interpretations!

I hate to chop up the poem into bits -- it feels a bit like spoon-feeding the reader, and it disrupts the flow of the poem -- but I spent two hours trying to figure out how to annotate line-by-line in markdown, to no avail. You can find the full, uninterrupted poem [here](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54316/canto-iv).

### Stanza 1

We open on the dawn following the fall of Troy, after the Greeks have razed the city from the inside out:

> Palace in smoky light, <br>
> Troy but a heap of smouldering boundary stones,              
> ANAXIFORMINGES!  Aurunculeia! <br>
> Hear me.&nbsp; &nbsp; Cadmus of Golden Prows! <br>

Now, Pound invokes the name of several mythological figures associated with rebuilding or rebirth. "Anaxiforminges" -- literally, "lords of the lyre", or hymns -- refers to Apollo, who helped Poseidon build the walls of Troy with the music of his lyre[^lyre]. "Aurunculeia" refers to Vinia Aurunculeia, the bride for whom the Roman poet Catallus wrote a [celebratory wedding song](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0006%3Apoem%3D61). Cadmus is the founder of Thebes; the "Gold Prows" are  the golden dragons that sat at the figureheads of his ships.

There is a tension between the still-burning ruins of Troy and the figures Pound has chosen to evoke. Apollo both created Troy and later sent a devastating plague upon its people [^apollo]. Cadmus raised the walls of Thebes from the blood-soaked lands of Boeotia [^cadmus] and later led his Thebans in the pillaging of Troy. Given Helen's role in causing the Trojan war, the invocation of a wedding song lauding the beauty of a bride "fair as Venus" is indeed deeply ironic. Regardless of its ambiguous portrayal, there is an clear cyclism (or dualism?) between creation and destruction [^wasteland]. 

[^lyre]: Ovid Heroid. xvi. 180

[^wasteland]: This same idea, applied to life and death, will feature prominently in T.S. Eliot's _The Wasteland_. 

[^apollo]: Having insulted Zeus, Apollo and Poseidon were ordered to disguise themselves as mortals and work for King Laomedon for a year, during which they built Troy. But Laomdeon was ungrateful and threatened to cut off their ears (and some other nasty stuff). As punishment, [Apollo sent a plague upon Troy, and Poseidon a sea monster.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/539834)

[^cadmus]: "So, having lived the space allotted them, the youthful warriors perished as they smote the earth (their blood-stained mother) with their breasts: and only five of all the troop remained; of whom Echion, by Minerva warned, called on his brothers to give up the fight, and cast his arms away in pledge of faith — when Cadmus, exiled from Sidonia's gates, builded the city by Apollo named, these five were trusted comrades in his toil." [Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book III](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D3%3Acard%3D95)

We flash to another dawn, of a distinctly different character:

> The silver mirrors catch the bright stones and flare, <br>
> Dawn, to our waking, drifts in the green cool light; <br>
> Dew-haze blurs, in the grass, pale ankles moving. <br>
> Beat, beat, whirr, thud, in the soft turf <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; under the apple trees, <br>
> Choros nympharum, goat-foot, with the pale foot alternate; <br>

Silver pools of water reflect the light of dawn, and the resulting flare of light transports us to a sacred grove. In contrast with the red-orange, fire-tinged dawn of Troy, we are now greeted with "green cool light"; the haze of smoke has been replaced with the blur of dew. The static image of ruined Troy is succeeded by the fluid dance of nymphs ("_choros nympharum_") and satyrs ("_goat-foot_");  it seems as though they are dancing in a circle ("_goat-foot, with the pale foot alternate_"). This motion begins softly, with the drifting of the dawn, then accelerates ("_blurs_", "_pale ankles moving_") into onomatopoeia. In this hypernatural forest -- an apple orchard, which was sacred to Aphrodite -- we find an order and clarity that clashes with the war-torn citadel of Troy. 

> Crescent of blue-shot waters, green-gold in the shallows, <br>
> A black cock crows in the sea-foam; <br>

Water will play a critical role in the rest of the poem; here is our first introduction to it. Notice the emphasis on color. We have shifted from the fiery-reds of dawn to the greens of the woods to the blue-green waters from which Aphrodite rose. The black rooster, which is also sacred to Apollo, is symbolic ("apparitional", according to Pound's own comments). Its cry is a warning of the destructive nature of love and passion, just as Paris's love for Helen brought Troy to its knees.

### Stanza 2

The next stanza entangles two myths of the same flavor (no pun intended). 

The first is that of [King Tereus and Queen Procne](http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/OvidPhilomela-1.pdf). Tereus rapes Procne's sister Philomela and cuts out her tongue so she cannot speak; nonetheless, Philomela is able to send Procne a tapestry on which she has woven a visual history of Tereus's crime. As revenge, Procne cooks her son Itys into a meal and tricks Tereus into eating it. As Procne and Philomela flee from an enraged Tereus, they are transformed into birds by the pitying gods -- Procne becomes a swallow and Philomela a nightingale. [^wasteland2]  

The second is that of [Count Roussillon and his wife Seremonda](http://ezrapoundcantos.org/index.php/a-draft-of-xvi-cantos-overview/canto-iv/iv-sources/146-cabestan). After learning of her affair with the troubadour Cabestan, Roussillon feeds Seremonda the heart of her lover. When she realizes the truth, Seremonda tells her husband, "you gave me so good a course that I will never eat anything else", and throws herself out the window before the enraged Count can kill her himself.

[^wasteland2]: We will see this myth resurface in _The Wasteland_. Here, however, the emphasis is on Procne and Tereus; Eliot puts a greater weight on Philomela ("_And there the nightingale \ Fills all the desert with inviolable voice..."_)

> And by the curved, carved foot of the couch, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp;claw-foot and lion head, an old man seated <br>
> Speaking in the low drone…: <br>

The identity of the "_old man_" is up to interpretation. Some take him to be Count Roussillon, who is musing on his murder of Cabestan and Seremonda's ensuing suicide. Others take him to be King Pandion of Athens, mourning his daughters Procne and Philomela.

<!-- Now, in the following lines, Pound will superimpose the two aforementioned legends, weaving from myth to myth; the result will be a sort of constructive interference that amplifies the emotional  -->

>  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Ityn! <br>
> Et ter flebiliter, Ityn, Ityn![^poem] <br>
> And she went toward the window and cast her down, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp;“All the while, the while, swallows crying: <br>
> Ityn! <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish.” <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish?” <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “No other taste shall change this.” <br>

[^poem]: "_And thrice pitifully, Ityn_". A reference to [Horace Odes Book IV Poem xii:5-8](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D4%3Apoem%3D12)

"_Ityn_" is the adjective form of "Itys" (and also sounds uncannily like "eaten"). Seremonda casts herself out the window; her fall is attended by the swallows of Procne. We rewind to the moments before her suicide:

> And she went toward the window, <br>
>  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;  the slim white stone bar <br>
> Making a double arch; <br>
> Firm even fingers held to the firm pale stone; <br>
> Swung for a moment, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;  and the wind out of Rhodez[^Rhodez] <br>
> Caught in the full of her sleeve. <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; . . .  the swallows crying: <br>
> ‘Tis.  ‘Tis.  ‘Ytis! <br>

[^Rhodez]: A region of southern France.

Just as the first half of this stanza presents a twinning of two myths, the second half presents another. 

The first myth recounts the misfortunes of Actaeon, who accidentally glimpsed Artemis and her retinue of nymphs as they bathed in a forested river. Outraged, Artemis changed him into a stag, and he was torn to pieces by his own hunting dogs. 

The second is a tale of the foolish troubadour [Peire Vidal](http://ezrapoundcantos.org/index.php/a-draft-of-xvi-cantos-overview/canto-iv/iv-sources/142-peire-vidal?start=1), who was so enamored with a lady named the "She-Wolf of Puegnautier" that he donned wolfskins and wandered the forests in her name. Mistaken for an actual wolf, the local shepard sicced their hunting dogs on him. 

> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Actæon… <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; and a valley, <br>
> The valley is thick with leaves, with leaves, the trees, <br>
> The sunlight glitters, glitters a-top, <br>
> Like a fish-scale roof, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Like the church roof in Poictiers[^poitiers] <br>
> If it were gold. <br>

This half of the stanza, along with the following stanza, appear to be narrated by Vidal as he is chased by the hounds. Frantic and exhausted, he recalls Ovid's rendition of the myth of Actaeon in harried fragments. Now, his mind snaps from the sun-dazzled canopy of the trees to the waters in which Artemis and her huntresses bathe.

[^poitiers]: Perhaps the [Poitiers Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poitiers_Cathedral)?

> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Beneath it, beneath it <br>
> Not a ray, not a slivver, not a spare disc of sunlight <br>
> Flaking the black, soft water; <br>
> Bathing the body of nymphs, of nymphs, and Diana, <br>
> Nymphs, white-gathered about her, and the air, air, <br>
> Shaking, air alight with the goddess <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; fanning their hair in the dark, <br>
> Lifting, lifting and waffing: <br>
> Ivory dipping in silver, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Shadow’d, o’ershadow’d <br>
> Ivory dipping in silver, <br>
> Not a splotch, not a lost shatter of sunlight. <br>

It is said that, upon perceiving the intruder, Artemis' nymphs immediately gathered around her so as to shield her modesty. Thus, all Actaeon could see was Artemis's hair.

> Then Actæon: Vidal, <br>
> Vidal. &emsp; It is old Vidal speaking, <br>
> &emsp; stumbling along in the wood, <br>
> Not a patch, not a lost shimmer of sunlight, <br>
>  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; the pale hair of the goddess. <br>

### Stanza 3
This next stanza continues Vidal's ramblings about Actaeon. 

> The dogs leap on Actæon, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; “Hither, hither, Actæon,” <br>
> Spotted stag of the wood; <br>
> Gold, gold, a sheaf of hair, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Thick like a wheat swath, <br>
> Blaze, blaze in the sun, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The dogs leap on Actæon. <br>

The death of Actaeon, which seem to foretell Vidal's fate, shakes the last vestiges of sanity out of Vidal. We observe as Vidal hobbles away from his pursuers:

> Stumbling, stumbling along in the wood, <br>
> Muttering, muttering Ovid: <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; “Pergusa… pool… pool… Gargaphia, <br>
> “Pool… pool of Salmacis.” <br>

Vidal exits by citing three bodies of water, all closely related to myths involving irresistable lust. Pergusa is a lake close to where Hades abducted Persephone [^lake]. Gargaphia is the valley where Artemis and her nymphs bathed [^valley]. Salmacis was a Naiad, a nymph who presided over a particular pool of springwater. When the handsome youth Hermaphroditus visited her pool, she fell in love at first sight; despite his rejections, she forced herself upon him and prayed to the gods to let them stay together forever. The gods answered her by fusing them together into one being with both male and female parts.[^herm]

[^lake]: Ovid Metamorphoses V 375-84
[^valley]: Ovid Metamorphoses III: 163-177
[^herm]: This is indeed the source of the term "hermaphrodite". Ovid's account [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D271).

> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The empty armour shakes as the cygnet moves. <br>
We conclude the stanza with the tale of Achillus and Cygnus, the son of Poseidon. Though Cygnus was blessed with invulnerability to weapons, Achilles beat him bloody with his bare hands and strangled him with his own helmet. Eager to strip Cygnus of his armor, Achilles ripped the helmet off, but found the armor empty, and Cygnus transformed into a swan by Poseidon [^swan].

[^swan]: [Metamorphoses 12: 64-145](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D12%3Acard%3D64)
