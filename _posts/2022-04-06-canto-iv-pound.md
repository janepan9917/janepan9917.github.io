I can't believe I used to think _The Wasteland_ was hard to read.

## _Canto IV_
I've had this poem bookmarked for about two years now, yet never got past the first stanza. Here's my annotations for others who are similarly mal-educated in the classics.

> Palace in smoky light, <br>
> Troy but a heap of smouldering boundary stones, <br>
> ANAXIFORMINGES!  Aurunculeia! <br>
> Hear me.&nbsp; &nbsp; Cadmus of Golden Prows!  <br>
