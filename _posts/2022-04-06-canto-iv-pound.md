I can't believe I used to think _The Wasteland_ was hard to read.

## _Canto IV_
I've had this poem bookmarked for about two years now, yet never got past the first stanza. Imagism is already hard enough to interpret, and Pound's work is quadruply so, with his allusions to obscure figures of classical mythology and superposition of sensory [ideograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideogrammic_method). For those of us who last read _Percy Jackson_ in fifth grade, I've tried to annotate _Canto VI_ as legibly as possible.

Disclaimer: I'm confident only in my ability to google non-English. No guarantees on the validity of any deeper interpretations!

Since two hours of googling around 

### Stanza 1
> Palace in smoky light, <br>
> Troy but a heap of smouldering boundary stones, <br>
> [ANAXIFORMINGES](http://bearlithia.blogspot.com/)!  Aurunculeia! <br>
> Hear me.&nbsp; &nbsp; Cadmus of Golden Prows! <br>
> The silver mirrors catch the bright stones and flare, <br>
> Dawn, to our waking, drifts in the green cool light; <br>
> Dew-haze blurs, in the grass, pale ankles moving. <br>
> Beat, beat, whirr, thud, in the soft turf <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; under the apple trees, <br>
> Choros nympharum, goat-foot, with the pale foot alternate; <br>
> Crescent of blue-shot waters, green-gold in the shallows, <br>
> A black cock crows in the sea-foam; <br>


### Stanza 2
> And by the curved, carved foot of the couch, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp;claw-foot and lion head, an old man seated <br>
> Speaking in the low drone…: <br>
>  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Ityn! <br>
> Et ter flebiliter, Ityn, Ityn! <br>
> And she went toward the window and cast her down, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp;“All the while, the while, swallows crying: <br>
> Ityn! <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish.” <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish?” <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “No other taste shall change this.” <br>
> And she went toward the window, <br>
>  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;  the slim white stone bar <br>
> Making a double arch; <br>
> Firm even fingers held to the firm pale stone; <br>
> Swung for a moment, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;  and the wind out of Rhodez <br>
> Caught in the full of her sleeve. <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; . . .  the swallows crying: <br>
> ‘Tis.  ‘Tis.  ‘Ytis! <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Actæon… <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; and a valley, <br>
> The valley is thick with leaves, with leaves, the trees, <br>
> The sunlight glitters, glitters a-top, <br>
> Like a fish-scale roof, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Like the church roof in Poictiers <br>
> If it were gold. <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Beneath it, beneath it <br>
> Not a ray, not a slivver, not a spare disc of sunlight <br>
> Flaking the black, soft water; <br>
> Bathing the body of nymphs, of nymphs, and Diana, <br>
> Nymphs, white-gathered about her, and the air, air, <br>
> Shaking, air alight with the goddess <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; fanning their hair in the dark, <br>
> Lifting, lifting and waffing: <br>
> Ivory dipping in silver, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Shadow’d, o’ershadow’d <br>
> Ivory dipping in silver, <br>
> Not a splotch, not a lost shatter of sunlight. <br>
> Then Actæon: Vidal, <br>
> Vidal. &emsp; It is old Vidal speaking, <br>
> &emsp; stumbling along in the wood, <br>
> Not a patch, not a lost shimmer of sunlight, <br>
  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; the pale hair of the goddess. <br>
