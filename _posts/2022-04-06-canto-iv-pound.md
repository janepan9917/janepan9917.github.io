I can't believe I used to think _The Wasteland_ was hard to read.

## _Canto IV_
I've had this poem bookmarked for about two years now, yet never got past the first stanza. Imagism is already hard enough to interpret, and Pound's work is quadruply so, with his allusions to obscure figures of classical mythology and superposition of sensory [ideograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideogrammic_method). For those of us who last read _Percy Jackson_ in fifth grade, I've tried to annotate _Canto VI_ as legibly as possible.

> Disclaimer: I'm confident only in my ability to browse Wikipedia and steal annotations from these [excellent](http://ezrapoundcantos.org/index.php/a-draft-of-xvi-cantos-overview/canto-iv/companion-to-canto-iv) [resources](https://www.towernotes.co.uk/literature-notes-52_Pound_Cantos_10.php). No guarantees on the validity of any deeper interpretations!

I hate to chop up the poem into bits -- it feels a bit like spoon-feeding the reader, and it disrupts the flow of the poem -- but I spent two hours trying to figure out how to annotate line-by-line in markdown, to no avail. You can find the full, uninterrupted poem [here](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54316/canto-iv).

### Stanza 1

We open on the dawn after the fall of Troy, after the Greeks have razed the city from the inside out:

> Palace in smoky light, <br>
> Troy but a heap of smouldering boundary stones,              
> ANAXIFORMINGES!  Aurunculeia! <br>
> Hear me.&nbsp; &nbsp; Cadmus of Golden Prows! <br>
> The silver mirrors catch the bright stones and flare, <br>

Now, Pound invokes the name of several mythological figures associated with rebuilding or rebirth. "Anaxiforminges" -- literally, "lords of the lyre", or hymns -- refers to Apollo, who helped Poseidon build the walls of Troy with the music of his lyre (Ovid Heroid. xvi. 180). Aurunculeia is a reference to a celebratory wedding song addressed to the bride Vinia Aurunculeia, written by the Roman poet [Catullus' poem 61](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0006%3Apoem%3D61). Cadmus is the founder of Thebes; the "Gold Prows" are  the golden dragons that sat at the figureheads of his ships.

There is a tension between the still-burning ruins of Troy and the figures Pound has chosen to evoke. Apollo both created Troy and later sent a devastating plague upon its people [^apollo]. Cadmus raised the walls of Thebes from the blood-soaked lands of Boeotia [^cadmus] and later led his Thebans in the pillaging of Troy. Given Helen's role in causing the Trojan war, the invocation of a wedding song lauding the beauty of a bride "fair as Venus" is indeed deeply ironic. Regardless of its ambiguous portrayal, there is an clear cyclism (or dualism?) between creation and destruction [^wasteland]. 

[^wasteland]: This same idea, applied to life and death, will feature prominently in T.S. Eliot's _The Wasteland_. 

[^apollo]: Having insulted Zeus, Apollo and Poseidon were ordered to disguise themselves as mortals and work for King Laomedon for a year, during which they built Troy. But Laomdeon was ungrateful and threatened to cut off their ears (and some other nasty stuff). As punishment, [Apollo sent a plague upon Troy, and Poseidon a sea monster.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/539834)

[^cadmus]: "So, having lived the space allotted them, the youthful warriors perished as they smote the earth (their blood-stained mother) with their breasts: and only five of all the troop remained; of whom Echion, by Minerva warned, called on his brothers to give up the fight, and cast his arms away in pledge of faith — when Cadmus, exiled from Sidonia's gates, builded the city by Apollo named, these five were trusted comrades in his toil." [Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book III](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D3%3Acard%3D95)

I'm honestly not sure what the silver mirrors are; perhaps the shields of the Greek soldiers, reflecting the crumbling Trojan stones and sunlight? I'm unconvinced by this, since I'm pretty sure the Ancient Greek [shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspis) were made of wood, and if they were coated with a metal, it would have been bronze, not brittle iron. 

In any case, we flash to another dawn, of a distinctly different character:

> Dawn, to our waking, drifts in the green cool light; <br>
> Dew-haze blurs, in the grass, pale ankles moving. <br>
> Beat, beat, whirr, thud, in the soft turf <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; under the apple trees, <br>
> Choros nympharum, goat-foot, with the pale foot alternate; <br>

In contrast with the red-orange, fire-tinged dawn of Troy, we are now greeted with "green cool light"; the haze of smoke has been replaced with the blur of dew. The static image of ruined Troy is succeeded by the fluid dance of nymphs ("_choros nympharum_") and satyrs ("_goat-foot_"). This motion begins softly, with the drifting of the dawn, then accelerates ("_blurs_", "_pale ankles moving_") into onomatopoeia.

> Crescent of blue-shot waters, green-gold in the shallows, <br>
> A black cock crows in the sea-foam; <br>

Water will play a critical role in the rest of the poem; here is our first introduction to it. Notice the emphasis on color; we have shifted from the fiery-reds of dawn to the greens of the woods to the blue-green waters from which Aphrodite rose. The black rooster is symbolic -- "apparitional", according to Pound's own comments -- and its cry warns us of the destructive nature of love and passion, just as the love of Paris for Helen brought Troy to its knees.

### Stanza 2
> And by the curved, carved foot of the couch, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp;claw-foot and lion head, an old man seated <br>
> Speaking in the low drone…: <br>
>  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Ityn! <br>
> Et ter flebiliter, Ityn, Ityn! <br>
> And she went toward the window and cast her down, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp;“All the while, the while, swallows crying: <br>
> Ityn! <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish.” <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish?” <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; “No other taste shall change this.” <br>
> And she went toward the window, <br>
>  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;  the slim white stone bar <br>
> Making a double arch; <br>
> Firm even fingers held to the firm pale stone; <br>
> Swung for a moment, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;  and the wind out of Rhodez <br>
> Caught in the full of her sleeve. <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; . . .  the swallows crying: <br>
> ‘Tis.  ‘Tis.  ‘Ytis! <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Actæon… <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; and a valley, <br>
> The valley is thick with leaves, with leaves, the trees, <br>
> The sunlight glitters, glitters a-top, <br>
> Like a fish-scale roof, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Like the church roof in Poictiers <br>
> If it were gold. <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Beneath it, beneath it <br>
> Not a ray, not a slivver, not a spare disc of sunlight <br>
> Flaking the black, soft water; <br>
> Bathing the body of nymphs, of nymphs, and Diana, <br>
> Nymphs, white-gathered about her, and the air, air, <br>
> Shaking, air alight with the goddess <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; fanning their hair in the dark, <br>
> Lifting, lifting and waffing: <br>
> Ivory dipping in silver, <br>
> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Shadow’d, o’ershadow’d <br>
> Ivory dipping in silver, <br>
> Not a splotch, not a lost shatter of sunlight. <br>
> Then Actæon: Vidal, <br>
> Vidal. &emsp; It is old Vidal speaking, <br>
> &emsp; stumbling along in the wood, <br>
> Not a patch, not a lost shimmer of sunlight, <br>
  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; the pale hair of the goddess. <br>
