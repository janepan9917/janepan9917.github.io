Why this blog, and what I plan on writing.

### Motivation  
------
I've been toying with the idea of a research/academic blog since undergrad. After reading several excellent posts by Gregory Gunderson -- including [his own motivation](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/) for starting and maintaining his research blog -- I decided I might as well give it a go myself. 

First, despite my undergraduate background in mathematics, I find myself a better verbal or linguistic thinker; in my studies, I often found myself translating abstract concepts to annotated diagrams and written explanations. I do this in my notes anyways, so I may as well add them to this blog.

Second, as Gregory noted, I've discovered a frustrating (and somewhat worrying) tendency for my understanding of machine learning and mathematics to be more surface-level than I'd like to believe. It is said that you do not understand a concept if you cannot teach it. While these blog posts may not guarantee understanding of linear algebra or machine learning theory or whatnot, it at least gets me a little closer to it.

Third, in these past six months, I realize more than ever that progress in research is not necessarily guaranteed. Ideas and hypotheses don't always pan out, and experiments fail or produce disappointing results. But a blog post is concrete, guaranteed proof of progress in my own knowledge and understanding.

Fourth, I worry that I am losing my love for language in its purest form. For the first two decades of my life, I read and wrote voraciously, and there was a music in prose that I sought to employ in all of my writings. I hope I can somehow reclaim it.

Finally, I recognize I am in a particularly vulnerable stage between entering research and reaching research maturity. I've ventured past the well-mapped territories of online tutorials or textbook knowledges, and now I find myself in a sort of no man's land, and my own ill-formed vision and intuition seem to indicate no end in sight. I'm sure many others have documented similar experiences, but these are usually written after having surmounted them. I hope others in a similar place of their research career might read this blog and know that they, in this moment, are not alone in their own worries or insecurities.
