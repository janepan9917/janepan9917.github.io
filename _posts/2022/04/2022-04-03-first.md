Why this blog, and what I plan on writing.

Motivation  
------
I've been toying with the idea of a research/academic blog since undergrad. After reading several excellent posts by Gregory Gunderson -- including [his own motivation](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/) for starting and maintaining his research blog -- I decided I might as well give it a go myself. This is for several reasons. 

First, despite my undergraduate background in mathematics, I find myself a better verbal or linguistic thinker; in my studies, I often found myself translating abstract concepts to annotated diagrams and written explanations. I do this in my notes anyways, and I may as well translate them to this blog so that others, or at l

Second, as Gregory noted, I've found a frustrating (and somewhat worrying) tendency for my understanding of machine learning and mathematics to be more surface level than I'd like to believe. It is said that you do not understand a concept if you cannot teach it. I'd like to prove to myself that I indeed can teach an arbitrary audience about structured prediction or linear algebra or whatnot. While this may not guarantee understanding, it at least gets me a little closer to it.

Third, in these past six months, I realize that progress in one's project is not necessarily guaranteed. Ideas and hypotheses don't always pan out, and experiments fail or produce disappointing results. But a blog post is concrete proof of guaranteed progress in my own knowledge and understanding. I hope that this concreteness improves

\sigma_j = \nu/\sqrt{n_j}   \\
\theta = \mu +\tau \times \eta \\
