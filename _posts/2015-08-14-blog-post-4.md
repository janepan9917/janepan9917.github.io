I can't believe I used to think _The Wasteland_ was hard to read.

## _Canto IV_
I've had ==this== poem bookmarked for about two years now, yet never got past the first stanza. Here's my annotations for others who are similarly mal-educated in the classics.

>	I wandered == lonely == as a cloud <br />
>	That floats on high o'er vales and hills, <br />
>	When all at once I saw a crowd, <br />
>	A host, of golden daffodils; <br />
>	Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br />
> Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. <br />
